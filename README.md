## Detection and Recognition of Amharic Scene Text using MMOCR toolboxs  

MMOCR is an open-source toolbox based and for details of installation and relate information see (https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr. 

Ge Ωez/Abugida/Ethiopic script has up 519 characters. For Amharic, we use 289-319 characters depending on whether we use Ethiopic numerals and punctuation. There are no capital or small letters. 

The datasets for both detection and recognition can be downloaded from the website https://dk-liang.github.io/HUST-ASTD/. 
The LMDB related dataset link will be provided very soon. 
## Amharic Text Detection dataset preprocessing

We have two datasets for the detection task. HUST-ART is the real word dataset, and HUST-AST is the synthetic dataset. HUST-ART consists of 1500 training images and 700 test images. HUST-AST comprises 75,904 training images.
 To convert the datasets labels to MMOCR format, use tools/data/textdet/icdar_converter.py as follows

 python tools/data/textdet/icdar_converter.py det_datasets/HUST-ART -o det_datasets/HUST-ART -d icdar2015 --split-list training test

## Amharic Text Recognition  
We have two training sets and two test sets datasets. Tana (TN) and Waliya (WL) training set consist of 2.85 and 4M cropped words, respectively. HUST-ART and ABE test sets consist of 4039 and 5218 text images. We also have a validation dataset consisting of 14835 text images, which is the training part of HUST-ART and ABE. All five datasets are in LMDB format.  

MMOCR usage
1.  In the directory configs/_base_/recog_pipelines/, you have different pipelines you must change dict(type='LoadImageFromFile') to dict(type='LoadImageFromLMDB'),   
2.  In the directory configs/_base_/recog_datasets/, you need to modify the path of test and train datasets.
3.  In the directory mmocr/models/textrecog/convertors/ base.py define the dictionary using the 314 Amharic characters. No need to worry we have modified it. Based on your character set, modify dict_type in all other related files. We have modified the configs/textrecog/satrn/satrn_small.py settings. You can use it as an example.
